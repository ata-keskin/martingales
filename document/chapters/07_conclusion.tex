\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

This thesis has been dedicated to the formalization of martingales in arbitrary Banach spaces, using the proof assistant Isabelle. Our central objective was to provide a rigorous foundation for this endeavor and expand upon existing formalizations. As we conclude our work, we reflect upon the contributions we have made.

A major achievement of our work is the extension of the conditional expectation operator from the familiar real-valued setting to the broader context of Banach spaces. This generalization allows for a more versatile and comprehensive approach to modeling stochastic processes, accommodating a wider range of applications. Furthermore, we have lifted many of the commonly used properties of the conditional expectation to this more general setting.

We have introduced locale definitions to characterize various types of stochastic processes and filtered measure spaces, which was essential in the development of martingale theory within Banach spaces. We have introduced corresponding locales for discrete-time and continuous-time processes. Additionally, we have characterized predictable processes in the discrete setting, using proof methods from measure theory.

Finally, we have laid the groundwork for the formalization of martingale theory. Prior to our work, there was no development of martingales in a general Banach space setting within \textsf{\ac{AFP}}. With our contributions, this gap has been addressed, offering a solid starting point for further formalization in the general theory stochastic processes.
