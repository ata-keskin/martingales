This thesis presents a formalization of martingales in arbitrary Banach spaces using Isabelle/HOL. We begin by examining formalizations in prominent proof repositories and extend the definition of the conditional expectation operator from the real numbers to general Banach spaces, drawing inspiration from prior work. We define filtered measure spaces, adapted, progressively measurable and predictable processes and rigorously formalize martingales, submartingales, and supermartingales. Additionally, our contributions expand the scope of Bochner integration techniques to general Banach spaces, and introduces additional lemmas and induction schemes for integrable functions. Our formalization provides a robust framework for future formalizations within the theory of stochastic processes.
