This thesis presents a formalization of martingales in arbitrary Banach spaces using Isabelle/HOL. The primary focus lies in the formal construction of the conditional expectation operator in Banach spaces, which extends the existing formulation for real-valued functions. 
Our main goal is to port the existing formalization of martingales from the mathematical proof repository \textsf{mathlib} to Isabelle/HOL. 

The formalization of martingales and stochastic processes is achieved through Isabelle's locale system. We define the locale \lstinline{stochastic_process} to formalize stochastic processes over arbitrary Banach spaces. Similarly, we introduce locales for adapted, progressively measurable and predictable processes. We show sublocale relations and basic lemmas concerning vector space operations. Filtered measure spaces and $\sigma$-finite variants are formalized as well. Our formalization provides a robust framework for future formalizations within the theory of stochastic processes.
