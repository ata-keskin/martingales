This thesis presents a formalization of martingales in arbitrary Banach spaces using Isabelle/HOL. The primary focus lies in the formal construction of conditional expectation in Banach spaces, which extends the existing formulation for real-valued functions. We replicate existing lemmas about martingales from the mathematical proof repository mathlib, which is primarily developed in Lean, based on homotopy type theory (HoTT). While mathlib explores formalization in Lean, we choose Isabelle/HOL as the theorem prover due to its powerful locale system that provides a structured and modular framework for representing these dynamic systems. The formalization of martingales and stochastic processes is achieved through Isabelle's locale system. We define the locale \lstinline{stochastic_process} to formalize stochastic processes over arbitrary Banach spaces. Similarly, we define adapted, progressively measurable and predictable processes via the locales \lstinline{adapted_process}, \lstinline{progressive_process} and \lstinline{predictable_process}. We also show sublocale relations and simple lemmas concerning vector space operations. Filtered measure spaces and $\sigma$-finite variants are introduced with the locales \lstinline{filtered_measure} and \lstinline{sigma_finite_filtered_measure}. Similarly, the locales \lstinline{martingale}, \lstinline{submartingale} and \lstinline{supermartingale} are introduced to formalize martingales and related constructs in Banach spaces. Our formalization provides a robust mathematical framework for analyzing random processes.
