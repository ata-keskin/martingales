	abstract = {The book presents a self-contained overview of the state of the art in the complexity of lattice problems, with particular emphasis on problems that are related to the construction of cryptographic functions. Specific topics covered are the strongest known inapproximability result for the shortest vector problem; the relations between this and other computational lattice problems; an exposition of how cryptographic functions can be built and prove secure based on worst-case hardness assumptions about lattice problems; and a study of the limits of non-approximability of lattice problems. Some background in complexity theory, but no prior knowledge about lattices, is assumed},
